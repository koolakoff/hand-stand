The project contains of:
- the [6-DOF robotic arm from Aliexpress](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_onTxvrz) driven by PWM-controlled servos (DS3115 digital servo/MG996R analog servo)
- [Arduino mega 2560 r3](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_ooQZD0n) based controller
- a Windows UI app (python + tkinter lib)
- for connection between controller and Windows app it is used [Modbus RTU protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus#Modbus_RTU) (over RS232)
